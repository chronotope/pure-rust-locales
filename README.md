pure-rust-locales
=================

Pure Rust locales imported directly from the GNU C Library. `LC_COLLATE` and
`LC_CTYPE` are not yet supported.

`pure-rust-locales` **is not** an internationalization library by itself. It is
too low level for that. It provides only a very low level API. Is is meant to
be used by internationalization libraries.
